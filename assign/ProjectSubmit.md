CS370 Final Project Submission Instructions:
============================================

1. Obtain a blank CD (available in the back of KEC119)

2. Navigate to your final project directory, e.g. **CS370_Project**

3. Double-click the **.sln** file to load the project in Visual Studio 2013.

4. Click the green arrow in the toolbar to build and run your project (be sure it runs properly on the KEC123 lab computers).

5. Close Visual Studio.

6. Navigate into the Debug directory located in the same folder as the **.sln** file.

7. Copy the **.exe** file from this directory.

8. Navigate up one directory - back to where the **.sln** file is.

9. Navigate into the directory with the source files, e.g. **CS370_Project** subdirectory. Be sure you are in the directory with the **.cpp** files, image files, shader files, etc.

10. Paste the **.exe** file in the folder with the source files.

11. Navigate out to the folder where the outermost project directory is, e.g. **H:/CS370**.

12. Insert the blank CD and open the CD folder.

13. Drag-and-drop the **CS370_Project** outermost folder into the CD folder.

14. Burn the contents onto the CD (being sure to close the session if prompted).

15. After the CD has completed burning, eject the CD, reinsert it in the drive, open the CD folder, navigate into **CS370_Project/CS370_Project** (where the source files and executable are), and double-click on the executable file. Your program should execute WITHOUT launching Visual Studio.

16. Bring this CD to the final exam period.
